However, it is a great challenge to provide timely assessment and feedback to project teams and individual students with a frequency that catches up with iterative, incremental, and cooperative software development with continuous deliveries. Conventional project reviews are mostly dependent upon instructors and teaching assistants in a manual reviewing/mentoring approach, which are simply not scalable.In this paper, we argue that agile projects warrant a ""continuous delivery"" of personalized assessment and feedback. To this end, we propose an online-offline combined approach and built a system upon GitLab. An online platform was built by integrating DevOps tool chains so that personalized reports and assessments are delivered automatically to the teams/students, which serve as the very efficient trigger and basis for the close and targeted offline interactions between students and TAs: daily discussion over instant messaging and weekly in person meeting. This system has been in operation since 2014 for an undergraduate SE course, with over 500 students participating in over 130 project teams in total. Our results show that such a continuous assessment/feedback delivery system is very effective in educating Agile projects in SE courses.","assessment, software engineering course, devops, project, agile","","","ICSE-SEET '18"

At the same time, software quality is crucial in order to meet customers' expectations and hence succeed in the market. Therefore, current quality management processes require transformation in order to keep up with the fast pace of the market while at the same time meeting customers' expectations. In order to figure out how the current quality management process should be transformed to keep up with the fast pace of the market while ensuring both product quality and continuous deployment, we conducted a qualitative study at a large infrastructure provider company. During the interviews we conducted with the quality manager, developer and test architect, we used a metrics portfolio consisting of 59 candidate metrics that can be used in the transformed quality management process. Our findings show that, out of these candidate metrics, 9 metrics should be used in the internal quality measurement dashboard for quality check at the end of the software development life-cycle (SDLC) before the software is released to customer site, while 3 metrics should be used by quality manager to monitor earlier phases of SDLC and 5 metrics should also be delegated to earlier phases of SDLC but without the involvement of the quality manager. To summarize, our study support the claim that quality managers should not be only gatekeepers, but also proactive controllers of quality by monitoring earlier phases of the SDLC.","metrics, continuous deployment, software quality","","","ICSSP '18"

The goal of the presentation is to provide an overview of the challenges and approaches for automated scalability assessment in the context of DevOps and microservices. The focus of this presentation is on approaches that employ automated identification of performance problems because these approaches can leverage performance anti-pattern[5] detection technology. In addition, we envision extending the approach to recommend component refactoring. In our previous work[1,2] we have designed a methodology and associated tool support for the automated scalability assessment of micro-service architectures, which included the automation of all the steps required for scalability assessment. The presentation starts with an introduction to dependability, operational Profile Data, and DevOps. Specifically, we provide an overview of the state of the art in continuous performance monitoring technologies[4] that are used for obtaining operational profile data using APM tools. We then present an overview of selected approaches for production and performance testing based on the application monitoring tool (PPTAM) as introduced in [1,2]. The presentation concludes by outlining a vision for automated performance anti-pattern[5] detection. Specifically, we present the approach introduced for automated anti-pattern detection based on load testing results and profiling introduced in[6] and provide recommendations for future research.","","","","ICPE '20"

They share a set of important tenets such as independent development and deployment, high releasability, polyglot technology support, and loose coupling. A number of best practices for microservice architectures have been codified as patterns, which embody those tenets. However, no real-world microservices system can support all patterns and practices well, but rather architectural decisions making trade-offs among them are needed. Conformance to the patterns and practices selected in such decisions is hard to ensure and assess automatically, especially in large-scale, complex, and evolving systems. In this work, we propose a model-based approach based on generic, technology-independent metrics, tied to typical architectural design decisions in the microservice domain. With this approach we can measure conformance to the patterns and related tenets. We demonstrate and assess the validity and appropriateness of these metrics in performing an assessment of a system’s conformance to patterns through statistical methods.","","","",""

Introduction to DevOps Is a hands-on laboratory course that brings students through Git for source code management, Capybara for automated testing, AWS, Docker, and Ansible for automated virtual machine provisioning and configuration, and Jenkins for Continuous Integration. Unlike our current course offerings which primarily focus on the single developer context in a localized environment, this course prepares students for highly collaborative, team-based projects that use cloud resources to facilitate management of the software deployment pipeline. We developed this course based on feedback from our external advisory board and under consultation from a number of industrial partners.

Their security is a mandatory prerequisite for building trust in current and future digital ecosystems. IdM solutions are usually large-scale complex software systems maintained and developed by several groups of ICT professionals. Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline is adopted to make maintenance, extension, and deployment of such solutions as efficient and repeatable as possible. For security, CD pipeline is also used as a continuous risk assessment to quickly evaluate the security impact of changes. Several tools have been developed and integrated in the CD pipeline to support this view in the so called DevSecOps approach with the notable exception of a tool for protocol pentesting and compliance against standards such as SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. To fill this gap, we propose an approach to integrate Micro-Id-Gym—a tool for the automated pentesting of IdM deployments—in a CD pipeline.

In this application artists from different opera houses across the globe, can participate in a single united performance and interact almost as if they were co-located.One of the main design challenges in this application domain is to determine the composition of system components necessary to satisfy the desired quality of service in presence of failures and budget constraints. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that quality of service depends on a multitude of factors such as human perception of video and audio, the type of audience, performance elements, etc. These factors cannot be captured by traditional approaches for dependability evaluation such as reliability, i.e., continuous delivery of correct service. This calls for developing a more comprehensive ""Quality of Experience"" concept.In this paper, we propose a novel method to assess the quality of experience in presence of failures, based on a new metric called perceived reliability. This method can help the system designers and engineers compare architectural variants and to determine the dependability budget. We show the feasibility of our method by applying it to a World Opera performance.

Thereby, the EA model as a central artifact of EA is subject to a continuous evolution caused by multiple sources of changes. The continuous evolution requires a lot of effort in controlling and managing the evolution of the EA model. This is especially true when merging the induced changes from different sources in the EA model. Additionally, the lack of tool and automation support makes this a very time-consuming and error-prone task. The evolutionary character and the automated quality assessment of artifacts is a well-known challenge in the software development domain as well. To meet these challenges, the discipline of continuous delivery (CD) has emerged to be very useful. The evolution of EA model artifacts shows similarities to the evolution of software artifacts. Therefore, we leveraged practices of CD to practices of EA maintenance. Thus, we created a conceptual framework for automated EA model maintenance. The concepts were realized in a first prototype and were evaluated in a fictitious case study against equivalence classes based on EA model metrics and a set of several requirements for automated EA model maintenance from research. Overall, the concepts prove to be a promising basis for further refinement, implementation, and evaluation in research in an industrial context.","Enterprise architecture model maintenance, Continuous delivery, Enterprise architecture model evolution","","",""

DevOps has become a standard option for entities seeking to streamline and increase participation by all stakeholders in their Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). For a large portion of industry, academia, and government, applying DevOps is a straight forward process. There is, however, a subset of entities in these three sectors where applying DevOps can be very challenging. These are entities mandated by policies to conduct all or a portion of their SDLC activities in HREs. Often, the reason for an HRE is general security and protection of intellectual property. Even if an entity is functioning in a highly regulated environment, its SDLC can still benefit from implementing DevOps as long as the implementation conforms to all imposed policies. In this paper, we discuss the process of performing a DevOps assessment and implementation in an HRE which we refer to as HRE-DevOps.","DevOps, highly regulated environment, secure DevOps, SDLC, DevOps assessment","","","XP '18"

On the Dev side, DBAs evaluate change requests to ensure compliance with organizational best practices and guard against degradation of database performance and the validity of dependent objects. On the Ops side, DBAs perform release and troubleshooting activities in support of the application, manage the data platforms access and security, and monitor and maintain performance of the databases that they have designed and provisioned. DevOps, DBAs, and DBaaS investigates the complex intersection between DBA functions and DevOps processes. DevOps teams traditionally viewed DBAs as process outliers who disrupt and retard SDLC timelines. At each touch point, veteran DBA Mike Cuppett shows how DBAs can most effectively contribute to decreasing release cycle times and improving product resiliency by applying automation, orchestration, and DBaaS solutions to database administration in ways that dovetail with DevOps requirements and metrics. At a high level, Cuppett demonstrates the importance of leveling silo walls in the IT supply chain and of measuring application performance holistically by reference to satisfaction of customer requirements and end-user experience. At a technical level, he drills into topics and case studies on diagnosing and resolving problems commonly encountered by DBAs and DevOps teams when meshing database management with application delivery.

Cloud service providers use Cloud monitoring tools to ensure that rendered services match the quality of service requirements indicated in established contracts such as service-level agreements.Given the enormous number of resources that need to be monitored, highly scalable and capable monitoring tools are designed and implemented by Cloud service providers such as Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft. Cloud monitoring tools monitor millions of virtual and physical resources and continuously generate logs for each one of them. Considering that logs magnify any technical issue, they can be used for disaster detection, prevention, and recovery. However, logs are useless if they are not assessed and analyzed promptly. Thus, we argue that the scale of Cloud-generated logs makes it impossible for DevOps teams to analyze them effectively. This implies that one needs to automate the process of monitoring and analysis (e.g., using machine learning and artificial intelligence). If the automation will witness an anomaly in the logs --- it will alert DevOps staff.The automatic anomaly detectors require a reliable and scalable platform for gathering, filtering, and transforming the logs, executing the detector models, and sending out the alerts to the DevOps staff. In this work, we report on implementing a prototype of such a platform based on the 7-layered architecture pattern, which leverages micro-service principles to distribute tasks among highly scalable, resources-efficient modules. The modules interact with each other via an instance of the Publish-Subscribe architectural pattern. The platform is deployed on the IBM Cloud service infrastructure and is used to detect anomalies in logs emitted by the IBM Cloud services, hence the dogfooding. In particular, we leverage IBM Cloud Functions to deploy the computing modules, IBM Event Streams to establish communication among the modules, and IBM Cloud Object Storage and IBM Cloudant for persistent storage.The prototype efficiency is promising: it takes the platform 17 seconds or less from the point of receiving a new log record to emitting an alert to the IBM Cloud DevOps team.","","","","CASCON '19"

The digital enterprise is here, and its prime characteristic is that is essentially detaches and segregates existing businesses and reassembles them according to market demands. Every industry, from transportation to eyewear is up for disruption, and developers are in the forefront of this movement. In turn, these developers are under intense pressure to accelerate time to market. The compos able enterprise approach requires a reconsideration of traditional models of the entire IT organization. These organization and their processes need to be broken up into components that follow certain key design principles such as The Minimal Functions with least Dependencies, portability, Shared Knowledge, Predictable Contracts and Maximized Human Value. The last three bullet points encapsulate the very definition of DevOps [3]. The concept of better integration between Development and Operations is a valuable objective. The goal is to foster measurable incremental cultural change to derive most overall value out of the union of people, process and technology. But the cultural issues, reward models, and risk allocation create obvious barriers in attaining those goals. The common industry belief is to use the compos able enterprise framework to build a platform using the right tools and you will have attained DevOps nirvana. In this paper we will explore valuable lessons learned from our mistakes in tool centric adoption of IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) [8].

This paper presents a hybrid DevOps process with a systematic reuse‐based software development and management process to reduce the effort and cost required for the rework and to increase productivity. The proposed approach promotes the systematic reuse of software components based on both information retrieval and ontology‐based retrieval techniques. The reusable assets are presented in different styles to ease and support the reuse process with fine‐grained reusable artifacts. To evaluate our proposed process, a pilot project, aiming to monitor the health of a patient, was developed and monitored the reuse activities throughout the whole experiment. The results revealed that our proposed process got an average gain of 35.2% in terms of developed function points by reusing 30.63% of reusable artifacts available in the reuse repository.We proposed a hybrid DevOps process with a systematic reuse‐based software development and management process to reduce the effort and cost required for the rework and to increase productivity. DevOps encourage tool support during the software delivery process for quick delivery. Therefore, we have developed a reuse repository to support rapid delivery by reusing artifacts during the development process.

On the downside, software bugs and performance regressions have now become an important cause of downtime. We propose app-bisect, an autonomous tool to troubleshoot and repair such software issues in production environments. Our insight is that the evolution of microservices in an application can be captured as mutations to the graph of microservice dependencies, such that a particular version of the graph from the past can be deployed automatically, as an interim measure until the problem is permanently fixed. Using canary testing and version-aware routing techniques, we describe how the search process can be sped up to identify such a candidate version.

Due to modern development paradigms such as DevOps and microservice architectural styles, applications are decoupled into services with complex interactions and dependencies. Although these paradigms enable individual development cycles with reduced delivery times, they cause several challenges to manage the services in distributed systems. One major challenge is to observe and monitor such distributed systems. This paper provides a qualitative study to understand the challenges and good practices in the field of observability and monitoring of distributed systems. In 28 semi-structured interviews with software professionals we discovered increasing complexity and dynamics in that field. Especially observability becomes an essential prerequisite to ensure stable services and further development of client applications. However, the participants mentioned a discrepancy in the awareness regarding the importance of the topic, both from the management as well as from the developer perspective. Besides technical challenges, we identified a strong need for an organizational concept including strategy, roles and responsibilities.

It provides a leading forum for the exchange of academic research results and industrial best-practices in process development and evolution on software and systems disciplines.Software and system process decision-making is becoming more challenging for development organizations. These organizations are incorporating engineering advances, seeking to meet expectations of their customers, and responding to the economic pressures of markets. The resulting demands on processes include the need for both well-developed plans and incremental deliveries (agile and hybrid processes), utilization of increased automation (model-based engineering and DevOps), higher degrees of customer collaboration, comprehensive analysis of existing products for reuse (open source and COTS), and performance requirements of enterprise-level architectures.In response to these demands, process stakeholders---process engineers responsible for designing and implementing processes, managers or coaches who staff and guide them, researchers who study and improve them, tools developers who support and facilitate them, and developers and sustainers who use and tailor them---are producing more varieties of processes and doing so more often. Just as agility is required more frequently in product development, it is also being demanded in processes while maintaining their essential purposes of coordination and communication. Demands on processes are requiring processes on demand. Providing processes on demand is challenging for process designers. They must be able to select compatible process elements for a specific set of situational factors, to assess the risks in and forecast outcomes of a process design or improvement, to specify methods of implementation, and to monitor an enacted process quantitatively and identify needs for modifications. These capabilities require specialized knowledge and engineering methods from researchers.ICSSP 2018 has the conference theme ""Demands on Processes, Processes on Demand"" and seeks to explore the demands on processes that are requiring more variety and responsiveness in process development.","","","Proceedings",""
